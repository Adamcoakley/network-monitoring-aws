# network-monitoring-aws

## Problem 
"Our SysOps Administration team has been tasked to design and implement a network monitoring solution for our company. In the past, the company has detected malicious activities aimed at disrupting the network infrastructure at the company. We need you to devise a network monitoring solution that helps the company to meet compliance requirements, monitor key metrics and configure automated notifications in case of any suspected security event. On the network monitoring side, we want you to implement AWS VPC Flow Logs for your VPCs network interfaces.

To build a logging and notifications layer for the entire end-to-end solution, you will leverage CloudWatch filters and CloudWatch alarms to monitor AWS VPC Flow Logs that are ingested into CloudWatch Logs. We want you to report any security events via SNS notifications as soon as these are detected. You will need to build the analytics layer using Amazon Athena that analyzes the access trends for the VPC Flow Logs stored in S3."
